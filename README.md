# reimbursement-calc.com

[reimbursement-calc.com](http://reimbursement-calc.com/) calculates tuition reimbursement expiration dates and displays a running total of the amount owed.

When companies provide tuition reimbursement to employees they may require that the employee stay with the company for a certain amount of time or have to pay back the money. This site allows someone to enter the dates/amounts they were reimbursed along with the duration of the obligation and displays a running total of the amount owed.

Dates/amounts are stored using cookies.
